# SH09 Team Project - Project GUNDAM

## Description
Project GUNDAM is an augmented reality game developed for the University of Glasgow Games Lab and is available as an Android app.

The application works by placing models across the local area, and the user must go to these set location in the real world, once there, a quiz is given and if the correct answer is given, you earn the model at that specific location. Augmented reality can be used to display he model in the real world.

## How to Install and Run the Project
How to install:

How to run the project:

If you update the application, or decide to install the app again, please ensure that the previous version is uninstalled from the android device, otherwise the "black screen of death" may appear.

## How to Contribute to the Project
### On First Go, How to Clone
Open up a terminal environment and navigate to where you would want to save the project. Navigate to the github remote repository and click on the Code button dropdown. Click on the HTTPS section and copy the link available it should be something like: https://github.com/username/sh09-main.git . From here you want to clone the project. Go into your terminal where you have naviagted to where you would like to save the project.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/sh09-main.git 
```
### Collaborate with your team

- [ ] [Invite team members and collaborators](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/members/)
- [ ] [Create a new merge request](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/creating_merge_requests.html)
- [ ] [Automatically close issues from merge requests](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/managing_issues.html#closing-issues-automatically)
- [ ] [Enable merge request approvals](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/approvals/)
- [ ] [Set auto-merge](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/merge_when_pipeline_succeeds.html)

### Add your files

- [ ] [Create](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/web_editor.html#create-a-file) or [upload](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/web_editor.html#upload-a-file) files
- [ ] [Add files using the command line](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/add-file.html#add-a-file-using-the-command-line) or push an existing Git repository with the following command:
```
cd existing_repo
git remote add origin https://stgit.dcs.gla.ac.uk/team-project-h/2023/sh09/sh09-main.git
git branch -M main
git push -uf origin main
```
### After Cloning
Navigate to where you cloned the project to within your file directory, whilst in a terminal environment. Always make sure you are in the correct directory and folder. There is a sh09-main root repository and another sh09_main folder within that. Make sure you are in the one you want to be in.
Pull to make sure you have the most up to date version before editing:
```bash
git pull
```
You can then do the changes you want to make. You then want to commit your changes so that they are saved.
```bash
git add * #this adds all the changes you have made
git commit -m "put your commit message here"
```
When you want your local changes to be put on the remote github repository, you should push your changes.
```bash
git push
```
## Badges
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Usage
The application works similar to other AR games such as Pok√©mon Go, see screenshots below for the games usage.

## Roadmap

The project code freeze takes place on the 15th of March, from this point onwards the code is no longer required to be maintained or actively developed by the original team, however measure will be in place to ensure a stable app is released.

This project can and will be developed upon by the UofG Games Lab after the original team members code freeze. This can be done on this GitHub.

This project will be demonstrated at the Science Fiction conference in Glasgow.

## How to Run Tests
Use the built-in continuous integration in GitLab.
- [ ] [Get started with GitLab CI/CD](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/quick_start/index.html)
- [ ] [Analyze your code for known vulnerabilities with Static Application Security Testing(SAST)](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/)
- [ ] [Deploy to Kubernetes, Amazon EC2, or Amazon ECS using Auto Deploy](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/autodevops/requirements.html)
- [ ] [Use pull-based deployments for improved Kubernetes management](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/clusters/agent/)
- [ ] [Set up protected environments](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/environments/protected_environments.html)

## Project status

This project from April 2024 and beyond is no longer required to be maintained by the developers on this project, but further development from the UofG Games Lab will occur. Contributions will take place in the public repository and those wishing to work on further development should contact Timothy Peacock.
